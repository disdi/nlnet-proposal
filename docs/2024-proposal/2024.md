## **2024 Project Plans**

Until very recently, custom ASICs were very rare for small and medium companies due to the overall prohibitive cost of their production, which could only be afforded by few large companies. This high cost comes mainly from the very expensive commercial EDA tools used for chip designs. However, recently there have been opensource initiatives such as [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) which supported the production of a fully open source EDA toolchain from hardware description languages down to GDSII. 

The recent introduction of open source Process Design Kit (PDK) like [130nm BiCMOS process from IHP](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK), [SOI-CMOS PDK from Minimal Fab](https://github.com/mineda-support/ICPS2023_5), [130nm mixed-signal CMOS SKY130 from Skywater](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) and [GlobalFoundries' 180nm](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk) has also opened several opportunities for circuit designers and removed the roadblocks for ASIC designing.

When the performance of the system is not sufficient for realtime requirements, the system is normally supplemented with FPGAs. This drives up the cost due to the inability to apply economy of scale for safety-critical domains with high volumes such as the automotive. Thus automotive target ASICs are on the rise. However all digital IPs are closed source and their internal working are working under non-disclosure agreements(NDA) by semiconductor vendors.

Librecar Control project can benefit from the opensource hardware ecosystem by taking next natural step to make opensource CAN-Bus IP available on an integrated circuit. It aims to deliver a fully open source CAN-Bus digital IP to be built into an ASIC using Skywater 130nm Open PDK which is already synthesized and proven in FPGA as part of NLNET 2023 funding.


### **Target Consumers**

The project attempts to help solve the need for open source Hardware.

Open source hardware refers to a hardware, an ASIC, or even, a circuit that has provided access to its entire design, specifications, and documentations, which can be used, altered, or distributed by anyone. 

Like source code in case of open source software, all the schematics, logic designs, layout-data, and netlists need to be made available for revisions by anyone, who has access to the tools to read, manipulate and update the existing design with new features, usually aiming for better performance and share the improved design back to the community for further enhancements and evaluations.

This effort will help the opensource community in following ways:

- Access to an opensource CAN-Bus IP in ans ASIC and its entire design, specifications, and documentations. 
- Knowledge how to integrate any FPGA based design to an opensource ASIC with access to all logic designs, layout-data, and netlists.
- Access to Schematic and Board Design for communicating with automotive and industrial devices.
- Enables software developers to effectively optimize their source codes based on fully accessible hardware details of CAN-Bus IP.

> While the SKY130 process node and the PDK from which this open source release is derived have been used to create many designs that have been successfully manufactured commercially in significant quantities, the open source PDK is not intended to be used for production settings at this current time. It should be usable for doing test chips and initial design verification.

### **Overview**

> For hardware development, we needed for a long time to rely on commercial tools to simulate circuits and synthesize them targeting FPGAs or ASICs. FPGA tools from Intel (former Altera) and AMD (former Xilinx) are expensive and impossible to tinker with them as they are closed-source. For ASIC designs, we needed to use commercial tools, which are also pretty expensive.

**Only opensource tools and methodology is planned to be used in development of this project**.

For this project, we rely on below opensource tools:

* [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/), an open source framework for RTL synthesis. 
* OpenROAD, which is used in [OpenLane](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), delivers an end-to-end silicon compiler in open source, providing an automated layout generation flow from a design in RTLto GDSII/LEF files used to produce silicon chips.

* [SkyWater PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) is a catalog of standard logic cells that are designed for manufacturing at the SkyWater fab.

* [Caravel project](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides an already hardened harness which has a blank space of 2.920 µm × 3.520 µm left for a custom design. The harness includes a small RISC-V management core, clock management, digital IO pins, logic analyzer pins, and a Wishbone interface from the RISC-V core to the user design.
